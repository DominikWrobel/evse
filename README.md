# Install with HACS recomended:
It is possible to add it as a custom repository.

If you are using HACS, go to HACS -> Integrations and click on the 3 dots (top righ corner).
Then choose custom repositories, and add this repository url (https://github.com/DominikWrobel/evse), choosing the Integration category.

That's it, and you will be notified by HACS on every release.
Just click on upgrade.

# Manual install:
To use the evse custom component, place the file `evse` directory from the root of
the repository in to the folder `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/` where
you have your home assistant installation

The custom components directory is inside your Home Assistant configuration directory.

This is how your custom_components directory should be:
```bash
